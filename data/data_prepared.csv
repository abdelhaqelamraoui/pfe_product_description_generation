Whether you’re restyling your kitchen island or moving into a new place and without any dining furniture; counter or bar height stools are a convenient quick fix. The Stancoste swivel bar stool has a sturdy 4 leg base constructed from rubberwood. Rubberwood is a durable hardwood belonging to the maple family. Its dense grain character makes it a stable construction material that is naturally resistant to fungus and bacteria. The strong rubberwood frame is complimented by rich polyester upholstery. The long-term durability of polyester makes it an ideal choice of stool upholstery fabric for families with children and pets. Polyester upholstery is water repellent, stain resistant, budget friendly, and less prone to discoloration. Counter or bar height stools should combine style with convenience. The 360-degree swivel seat allows you to swivel either way with full mobility. The Stancoste bar or counter stool features a sophisticated wingback design, is available in your choice of 26 inch or 30 inch seat heights and comes in your choice of a gray oak wood finish with mocha fabric, or a brown oak wood finish with taupe or beige fabric upholstery.
